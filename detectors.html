<H1>GSECARS Detector-Related Software</H1>

This document describes the GSECARS-developed IDL software used for handling
x-ray detectors.  These are mainly routines for reading various file formats
which detector software packages create.
All of these IDL routines are available in a 
<A HREF="pub/idl_detector.tar">tar file</A>.

image plate reader.
<LI><A HREF="detector_routines.html#WRITE_PRINCETON">write_princeton.pro</A> 
is used to write .SPE files in the format used by Princeton Instruments (now Roper
Scientific) WinSpec and WinView software for their CCD detectors.
